This repository contains a desktop application built in C++ using the WinBGIm library, specifically designed for designing and simulating circuit boards and complex circuits. With this application, you can create, visualize, and analyze circuits with ease.

**Features**

The Circuit Designer Desktop App offers the following features:

User-Friendly Interface: The application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing you to design circuits efficiently.

Circuit Creation: Create circuits by adding components such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, and more to the circuit board canvas.

Simulation: Simulate the behavior of the designed circuit and observe voltage levels, current flows, and other characteristics.

Interactive Editing: Easily modify and reconfigure the circuit by adding, removing, or adjusting components and connections.

Save and Load: Save your circuit designs for future reference or load previously created circuits for further modifications.

Error Checking: The application includes error-checking functionality to identify and highlight potential issues in your circuit design.
